# Scrambling Letters
A lightweight javascript library for scrambling letters within a piece of text, giving a nice decoding effect.

Loops through any elements with the relevant data attribute and scrambles the letters randomly for a couple of seconds before returning them one by one to their original state.

Todo: Optimise code and allow for user config + tests.
